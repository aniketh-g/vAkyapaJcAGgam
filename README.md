# Vākyapañcāṅgams
The Vākya system is a method for computing the positions of heavenly bodies, popularly used in southern India. It employs the Kaṭapayādi system to encode the longitudes of a planet at regular intervals, in the form of meaningful Sanskrit sentences, tremendously reducing computational effort.

Astronomers of yore formulated these vākya-s based on the observations of their time, and have themselves instructed that they be updated in the future when the motions of the planets would inevitably change. This is an effort to compute the present longitudes of the planets and formulate vākya-s for them.

## Yogyādivākya-s
The Yogyādivākya-s are a set of 48 vākya-s (that begin with "yogya", as the name suggests) of 4 letters/digits each, arranged in 3 verses in the Anuṣṭup meter. They give the difference in the longitude of the mean and true Sun, starting from the beginning of each Solar month, at an interval of eight days.
